                    4.1 Discussion:
Inflammatory diseases include different types of rheumatic disorders such as rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarthritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus and osteoarthritis. Inflammation results in the liberation of endogenous mediators like histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, cytokines, and nitric oxide (McPhee et al., 2006).  Array of drugs are available to treat these disorders but only very few are free from toxicity. Gastrointestinal problems associated with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs are still an enduring dilemma of medical world. Purified natural compounds from plants can serve as template for the synthesis of new generation anti-inflammatory drugs with low toxicity and higher therapeutic value (Newman et al., 2003). Several models of inflammation and the possible mechanisms of actions are studied in-vitro and in vivo tests.
